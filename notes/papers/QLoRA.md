# QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs

- [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)
- [Code](https://github.com/artidoro/qlora)

### Key Takeaways
- __QLoRA__ is an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage of SOTA models to be finetuned on consumer grade hardware, while still preserving 16-bit finetuning task performance

### Highlights

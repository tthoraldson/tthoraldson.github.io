# Hello, World!

I'm looking to do a fresh start, with a fresh blog. I've had so many ideas that I've wanted to write about but have been too worried about formalities. I'm hoping that by having a blog that also stores my notes and fleeting thoughts I will be less concerned about having perfect content.

There are so many amazing papers to read, obscure concepts to explore, and ideas to bring to life. I look forward to starting this journey of sharing my learnings with the world~
